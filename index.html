    <!--
        components - seperate parts of a graph
        vertex - joints (junctions)
        edges - paths between vertices(directed edges called as arc(edge with an arrow head))
        components - like seperated 2 graphs

        
        total degree = num of edges * 2          // 2 because every edge has 2 end points
        no of egdes to gake graph should be an integer so graph exists

        hamilton path - path in a graph that go through every vertex
                        (සෑම ශීර්ෂයක් හරහාම ගමන් කරන ප්‍රස්ථාරයක මාර්ගය)

        hamilton circuit -  start and end at the same place(should go through every vertex)

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
        travesible - can go through one time at an edge and cover the whole graph(can go through vertices multiple times)
                    * vertices with odd degree should be 0 or 2 in order to be travesible(means if theres no odd degree vertices , it is travesible)

        not travesible - if cant cover all the edges its not travesible

        euler path - vertices with odd degree = 2
                    should be a connected graph
                    should be travesible
                    starting degree and ending degree is different
                    can go through the same degree few times
                    start with an odd degree and end with an odd degree(not the same degree, different degrees)

        euler circuit - vertices with odd degree = 0
                        should be a connected graph
                        should be travesible
                        starting degree and ending with the same degree
                        can go through the same degree few times
