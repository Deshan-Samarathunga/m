    <!--
        components - seperate parts of a graph
        vertex - joints (junctions)
        edges - paths between vertices(directed edges called as arc(edge with an arrow head))
        components - like seperated 2 graphs
        out degree - vertex eken iwathata yana arcs(arrow head eka vertex eken pita direction ekata yana)
        innder degree - vertex eka dishawata ena arcs(arrow head eka vertex eka patthata ena)

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
u to v arc
 u ➡️ v(arrow head on the side of v) = so u is adjacent to v  = u is adjacent from v(the same thing)

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

        total degree = num of edges * 2          // 2 because every edge has 2 end points
        no of egdes to gake graph should be an integer so graph exists

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
        hamilton path - path in a graph that go through every vertex
                        (සෑම ශීර්ෂයක් හරහාම ගමන් කරන ප්‍රස්ථාරයක මාර්ගය)
        hamilton circuit -  start and end at the same place(should go through every vertex)

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
        travesible - can go through one time at an edge and cover the whole graph(can go through vertices multiple times)
                    * vertices with odd degree should be 0 or 2 in order to be travesible(means if theres no odd degree vertices , it is travesible)

        not travesible - if cant cover all the edges its not travesible
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
        euler path - vertices with odd degree = 2
                    should be a connected graph
                    should be travesible
                    starting degree and ending degree is different
                    can go through the same degree few times
                    start with an odd degree and end with an odd degree(not the same degree, different degrees)

        euler circuit - vertices with odd degree = 0
                        should be a connected graph
                        should be travesible
                        starting degree and ending with the same degree
                        can go through the same degree few times
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

isomorphic graph
        same number of components
        same number of vertices
        same number of edges
        same degree sequence(degree order from start to end should be same)
        same number of paths of any given length k
        same number of cycles of any given length k


-----------------Matrix

///////////////////////
identity matrix(if a matrix multiplie by identity matrix we get same matrix)  means A.I = A
1


1 0
0 1

1 0 0
0 1 0
0 0 1


/////////////////
(AT)AT = A
if A = -AT it is called skew symmetric
if A = AT it is called symmetric matrix
